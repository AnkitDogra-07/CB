## Introduction
The "Chatbot for Technology" project aims to leverage natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to create a virtual assistant capable of engaging with users, understanding their queries, and providing relevant information and services. The chatbot primarily serves developers by providing insights derived from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey data.

## Objectives
The key objectives of the project include:
- Implementing NLP capabilities to understand user queries.
- Extracting valuable insights from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey data.
- Providing personalized statistics on programming languages, frameworks, and trends.
- Acting as a virtual assistant to help users make informed decisions about their coding journey.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:
- **Streamlit**: Provides the frontend interface for user interaction.
- **LangChain and Hugging Face**: Backend technologies for NLP and AI capabilities.

### Streamlit Frontend
Streamlit is used to create an intuitive and interactive user interface that bridges the gap between the backend and the users.
